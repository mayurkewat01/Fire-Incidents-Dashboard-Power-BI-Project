# Fire-Incidents-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project

1. Introduction

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze global fire incidents data. The dashboard highlights the human, economic, and operational impacts of fire disasters across multiple countries, helping stakeholders understand patterns and make data-driven decisions.

The major goals of this project are:

To identify casualty trends (deaths, injuries, firefighter injuries, lives saved).

To measure economic losses due to fire incidents.

To analyze root causes of fires such as negligence, arson, and electrical faults.

To study temporal trends in fire incidents across years.

To provide an interactive filtering feature to analyze country-specific data.

2. Data Overview

Dataset Size & Structure: Records of fire incidents from 10 countries.

Key Columns:

Country â€“ Incident location.

Cause â€“ Reason (Negligence, Arson, Electrical Faults, Industrial Accidents, Wildfires).

Deaths, Injuries, Firefighter Injuries â€“ Casualty statistics.

Lives Saved â€“ Rescues performed by firefighting teams.

Economic Loss â€“ Estimated financial damages in USD.

Response Time â€“ Average firefighting response time (minutes).

Year â€“ Timeline of incidents.

Data Quality: The dataset is clean and ready for visualization, containing both categorical and numerical variables.

3. Data Preparation

Data was imported into Power BI Desktop for visualization.

Columns were categorized into dimensions (categorical data) and measures (numerical data).

Basic formatting was applied for clarity (e.g., currency for losses, percentages for causes).

A dark theme was chosen for better contrast and readability.

4. Dashboard Visualizations
4.1 KPI Indicators

Total Economic Loss: 256K

Total Injuries: 502K

Total Deaths: 252K

Lives Saved: 397K

Firefighter Injuries: 49K

Average Response Time: 30.70 minutes

Countries Covered: 10

ðŸ‘‰ Provides an at-a-glance overview of the scale of fire incidents.

4.2 Average Deaths by Country

Type: Bar Chart

Shows which countries record higher average deaths.

Japan, Russia, and USA show higher impact, indicating need for better safety infrastructure.

4.3 Economic Loss by Country

Type: Column Chart

Displays total financial damages.

Russia, Australia, and Japan have the highest economic losses.

4.4 Lives Saved by Country

Type: Donut Chart

Highlights the number of lives saved by country.

South Africa (49K) and India (41K) lead in rescue efficiency.

4.5 Incidents by Cause

Type: Pie Chart

Categorizes incidents:

Negligence â€“ 21.8%

Arson â€“ 21.1%

Electrical Faults â€“ 20.9%

Industrial Accidents â€“ 16.1%

Wildfires â€“ Remaining share

Highlights negligence and arson as leading causes.

4.6 Injuries by Year

Type: Line Graph

Shows trends from 2000â€“2025.

Helps identify years with major spikes for historical learning.

4.7 Country Slicer (Interactive Filter)

Type: Slicer

Allows users to filter all visuals by country.

Example: Selecting India updates KPIs and charts to show only Indian data.

Makes the dashboard highly interactive for regional analysis.

5. Key Insights

Negligence, Arson, and Electrical Faults are the top causes of fires.

Russia, Australia, and Japan face the highest economic losses.

South Africa and India perform well in terms of lives saved.

Most employees (firefighters) face injury risks in high-response regions.

Fire incidents fluctuate over years, with noticeable spikes in certain periods.

6. Recommendations

Preventive Awareness Programs to reduce negligence and arson-related fires.

Stronger Fire Safety Infrastructure in high-loss countries.

Recognition and Support Programs for firefighters in high-response regions.

Policy-driven initiatives to minimize electrical hazards and industrial accidents.

Yearly monitoring systems to predict and prepare for peak-risk periods.

7. Conclusion

The Fire Incidents Dashboard successfully consolidates large-scale data into a clear, interactive, and insightful visualization.
By combining KPIs, country comparisons, cause analysis, and time-based trends, it serves as a powerful tool for policymakers, safety organizations, and firefighting departments.

The interactive slicer feature enhances usability, allowing users to deep dive into country-specific insights while maintaining a global perspective.

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used for real-time monitoring, decision-making, and predictive planning in fire safety management.
